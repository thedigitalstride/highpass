## Animation Explanations

### Page Transitions
Pages fade in with a subtle upward slide using Framer Motion's `AnimatePresence`. The custom easing curve creates natural motion.

### Parallax
The `useScroll` hook tracks scroll position, and `useTransform` maps that to element position. Different speeds create depth illusion.

### Scroll Reveals
`react-intersection-observer` detects when elements enter viewport. Once triggered, Framer Motion animates opacity and position.

### Testimonial Slider
Embla Carousel handles the core sliding logic. React state tracks current slide. Auto-play interval advances slides every 5 seconds unless user is hovering.

### Hover Effects
CSS transitions handle most hover effects for performance. Scale transforms and shadow increases provide tactile feedback.

### Underline Effects
Pseudo-elements with `scaleX` transforms expand from left to right on hover. `transform-origin: left` ensures they start from the correct side.

## Known Limitations

- Photo placeholders need real images
- Contact form currently shows success without backend
- No actual email integration (requires server-side setup)
- Social links point to # (need real URLs)

## Success Metrics

All implementation plan todos completed:
1. ✓ Theme setup with custom colors
2. ✓ Dependencies installed
3. ✓ Base UI components created
4. ✓ Navigation with mobile menu
5. ✓ Hero with parallax
6. ✓ Features grid with animations
7. ✓ Testimonial slider (exact Custo design)
8. ✓ About section with parallax
9. ✓ CTA section and footer
10. ✓ Page transitions implemented
11. ✓ All effects polished and responsive

## Server Information

The development server is now running at:
**http://localhost:3000**

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev    # Development server (currently running)
npm run build  # Production build
npm run start  # Start production server
npm run lint   # Run linter
```

## Conclusion

The coaching site is complete and ready for customization. All planned features have been implemented with mobile-first responsive design, smooth animations, and the exact testimonial slider design from Custo.io. The modular component structure makes it easy to customize and extend.
